<div class="esv">
<div class="esv-text">
<p id="p42001005.07-1">In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.</p>
 <p id="p42001008.01-1">Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.&#x201D;</p>
 <p id="p42001018.01-1">And Zechariah said to the angel, &#x201C;How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.&#x201D; And the angel answered him, &#x201C;I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.&#x201D; And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.</p>
 <p id="p42001024.01-1">After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, &#x201C;Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.&#x201D;</p>

<p id="p42001026.05-1">In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said, &#x201C;Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!&#x201D; But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.&#x201D;</p>
 <p id="p42001034.01-1">And Mary said to the angel, &#x201C;How will this be, since I am a virgin?&#x201D;</p>
 <p id="p42001035.01-1">And the angel answered her, &#x201C;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy&#x2014;the Son of God. And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.&#x201D; And Mary said, &#x201C;Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.&#x201D; And the angel departed from her.</p>

<p id="p42001039.04-1">In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she exclaimed with a loud cry, &#x201C;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.

<p id="p42001057.07-1">Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father, but his mother answered, &#x201C;No; he shall be called John.&#x201D; And they said to her, &#x201C;None of your relatives is called by this name.&#x201D; And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, &#x201C;His name is John.&#x201D; And they all wondered. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea, and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, &#x201C;What then will this child be?&#x201D; For the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>
 
<p id="p42001067.03-1">And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,</p>
 <blockquote>

 that we should be saved from our enemies<br/>and from the hand of all who hate us;<br/>
 to show the mercy promised to our fathers<br/>and to remember his holy covenant,<br/>
 the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us<br/>that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies,<br/>
might serve him without fear,<br/>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.<br/>
 And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;<br/>for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,<br/>
 to give knowledge of salvation to his people<br/>in the forgiveness of their sins,<br/>
 because of the tender mercy of our God,<br/>whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high<br/>

When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &#x201C;Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.&#x201D; All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:</p>
 <blockquote>
<p class="line-group" id="p40001023.01-1">&#x201C;Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,<br/>and they shall call his name Immanuel&#x201D;</p></blockquote>

And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.

 <p id="p42002015.01-1">When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &#x201C;Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.&#x201D; And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</p>

#### Luke 2:21-38
<div class="esv">
<div class="esv-text"><p id="p42002021.01-1">And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>
 
<p id="p42002022.06-1">And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, &#x201C;Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord&#x201D;) and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, &#x201C;a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.&#x201D; Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</p>
 <blockquote>
<p class="line-group" id="p42002029.01-1">&#x201C;Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace,<br/>according to your word;<br/>
 for my eyes have seen your salvation<br/>that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,<br/>
 a light for revelation to the Gentiles,<br/>and for glory to your people Israel.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
 <p id="p42002033.01-1">And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him. And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, &#x201C;Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.&#x201D;</p>
 <p id="p42002036.01-1">And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin, and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.</p>

<p id="p40002013.05-1">Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, &#x201C;Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.&#x201D; And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, &#x201C;Out of Egypt I called my son.&#x201D;</p>
 
<p id="p40002016.05-1">Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:</p>
 <blockquote>
<p class="line-group" id="p40002018.01-1">&#x201C;A voice was heard in Ramah,<br/>weeping and loud lamentation,<br/>
Rachel weeping for her children;<br/>she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
 
<p id="p40002019.05-1">But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, &#x201C;Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.&#x201D; And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.</p>
